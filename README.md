Python Chess Board
==================

Small Python script that sets up a chess board and allows 2 players to play with each other on a terminal.

Features:

1.  Timer for each player
2.  Minimal move validation and appropriate messages

How to Play:

Just open a terminal in a Linux box and run:


`git clone https://github.com/georgepsarakis/python-chess-board.git`
`cd python-chess-board`
`./chessboard.py --help`

to get a list of the command line arguments (basically the usernames) or just:

`./chessboard.py`

to start a game!
